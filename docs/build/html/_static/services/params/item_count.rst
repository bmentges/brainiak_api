**do_item_count**: If set to 1 determines that the resulting page will compute the property ``Ã¬tem_count`` with total number of items.
When set, this parameter also has the side effect of including the URL for the ``last`` page in the links section.
By default ``do_item_count`` is set to 0 for performance's sake and can be omitted.
