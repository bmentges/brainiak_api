Using HTTP methods in a RESTful way
===================================

The HTTP verbs comprise a major portion of our “uniform interface” constraint and provide us the action counterpart to
the noun-based resource. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST,
GET, PUT, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are
a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently. Of those less-frequent methods, OPTIONS and HEAD are used
more often than others.

Below is a table summarizing recommended return values of the primary HTTP methods in combination with the resource URIs:


+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
|  HTTP                                             | Entire Collection                             | Specific Item                       |
|  Verb                                             | (e.g. /place/City)                            | (e.g. /place/City/{id})             |
+===================================================+===============================================+=====================================+
| HEAD, can be issued against any resource to get   |                                               |                                     |
| just the HTTP header info.                        |                                               |                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| GET, used for retrieving resources.               | 200 (OK), list of cities. Use pagination,     | 200 (OK), single city.              |
|                                                   | sorting and filtering to navigate big lists.  | 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or |
|                                                   |                                               | invalid.                            |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| PUT, used for replacing resources.                | 404 (Not Found), unless you want to           | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content).       |
| For PUT requests with no <code>body</code>        | update/replace every resource in the          | 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or |
| attribute, be sure to set the                     | entire collection.                            | invalid.                            |
| <code>Content-Length</code> header to zero.       |                                               |                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| POST, used for creating resources, or performing  | 201 (Created), 'Location' header with link to | 404 (Not Found).                    |
| custom actions (such as merging a pull request).  | /place/City/{id} containing new ID.           |                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| DELETE, used for deleting resources.              | 404 (Not Found), unless you want to delete    | 200 (OK). 404 (Not Found), if ID    |
|                                                   | the whole collection—not often desirable.     | not found or invalid.               |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| PATCH, used for updating resources with partial   |                                               | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content).       |
| JSON data. For instance, an Issue resource has    |                                               | 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or |
| <code>title</code> and <code>body</code>          |                                               | invalid.                            |
| attributes. A PATCH request may accept one or     |                                               |                                     |
| more of the attributes to update the resource.    |                                               |                                     |
| PATCH is a relatively new and uncommon HTTP verb, |                                               |                                     |
| so resource endpoints also accept POST requests.  |                                               |                                     |
