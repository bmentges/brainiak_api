Brainiak API documentation!
============================


Linked data offers a set of best practices for publishing, sharing and linking data and information on the web.
It is based on use of http URIs and semantic web standards such as RDF.

For some web developers the need to understand the RDF data model and associated serializations and query language (SPARQL) has proved a barrier to adoption of linked data.
This project seeks to develop APIs, data formats and supporting tools to overcome this barrier.
Including, but not limited to, accessing linked data via a developer-friendly JSON format.

The Brainiak API provides a configurable way to access RDF data using simple RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to a SPARQL endpoint.
