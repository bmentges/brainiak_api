Create a Instance
=================

This service allows the creation of a new instance, provided its context, class name and JSON.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

  $ curl -i -X POST -T "new_city.json" http://api.semantica.dev.globoi.com/v2/place/City

.. program-output:: curl -i -s -H "Expect:" -X POST -T "services/instance/examples/new_city.json" http://api.semantica.dev.globoi.com/v2/place/City
  :shell:

Sample JSON "new_city.json" for the class City_:

.. _City: http://api.semantica.dev.globoi.com/v2/place/City/_schema

.. include :: examples/create_instance_payload.rst

Note that prefixes are defined in the "@context" section. 
`Default prefixes  <http://api.semantica.dev.globoi.com/v2/_config/Prefixes>`_ are implicit and don't need to be declared.


.. 

Optional query string parameters
--------------------------------

**class_prefix**: by default, the class URI is defined by the API's convention (context_uri/class_name). If the convention doesn't apply, provide class_prefix so the URI will be: class_prefix/class_name.  Example:

.. code-block:: http

  POST 'http://localhost:5100/place/City?class_prefix=http%3A//dbpedia.org/' new_city.json

If no **class_prefix** had been provided, the class URI above would be resolved as: http://semantica.globo.com/place/City. As **class_prefix** was defined, the class URI will be: http://dbpedia.org/City.

Possible responses
------------------


Status 201
__________

The instance was created successfully, the response body is empty.
The URI of the new instance is identified by the "Location" header in
the HTTP response.

Note that the URI of a instance is not the same as the URL to retrieve
a instance from the API. For retrieving it, use the retrieve instance primitive <>.

Status 400
__________

If there are unknown parameters in the request, the response status code
is 400 and the body contains a JSON containing valid and invalid parameters.

.. include :: examples/get_instance_400.rst

The 400 status may also happen when the JSON provided is invalid:

.. include :: examples/create_instance_400.rst

Status 404
__________

If the class does not exist, the response status code is 404.

.. code-block:: http

  POST 'http://localhost:5100/place/Person' JSON

.. include :: examples/create_instance_404.rst

Status 500
__________

Internal server error. Please, contact the team <semantica@corp.globo.com>
and provide the URL, JSON and error messaage.
