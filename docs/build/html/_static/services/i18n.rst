Internationalization
====================

Brainiak supports the internationalization of:

 1. Error messages, and
 2. Ontology & instances string literals

It is possible to define the default language of both by editing ``settings.py``'s ``DEFAULT_LANG`` variable.

Despite this, it is also possible to customize the language of (2) in most of Brainiak services, by adding ``lang=pt`` to the request querystring.

Developers' notes
-----------------

Brainiak error messages are translated using GETTEXT.

The following steps must be followed in order to internationlize a phrase inside Brainiak source code:

 i. Wrap the string to be translated using _().
 E.g. if "some expression" must be translated, replace it by _("some expression")

 ii. Create or update Brainiak translation template:
 ``make translate_template``

 iii. Update Brainiak Portuguese dictionary based on translation template
 ``make portuguese_dictionary``

 iv. Compile Portuguese dictionary, so the machine can understand the translations
 ``make compile_portuguese``
