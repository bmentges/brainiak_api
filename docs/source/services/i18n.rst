Internationalization
====================

Brainiak supports the internationalization of:

 1. Error messages, and
 2. Ontology & instances string literals

It is possible to define the default language of both by editing ``settings.py``'s ``DEFAULT_LANG`` variable.

Despite this, it is also possible to customize the language of (2) in most of Brainiak services, by adding ``lang=pt`` to the request querystring.
