**Status 409**

.. _conflict:

When there is a conflict, i.e. the instance is refered by another, there is a dependency between them and
therefore, the instance cannot be deleted, for consistency. To delete an instance you should first delete
instances that depend on it.

The response status is 409 and a JSON informing the dependants is returned.
