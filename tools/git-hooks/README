Git hooks is used to prevent mistakes.

We cannot commit code with statements like pdb, print, or exposing internal data such as ontology URIs

To install copy the pre-commit file to the .git/hooks of the project and
turn it into an executable file: chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

On the next commit, it will work.
