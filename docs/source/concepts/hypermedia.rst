Hypermedia Support
==================

All resources may have one or more links properties linking to other resources.
These are meant to provide explicit URLs so that proper API clients donâ€™t need to construct URLs on their own.
It is highly recommended that API clients use these. Doing so will make future upgrades of the API easier for developers.
All URLs are expected to be proper RFC 6570 URI templates.
